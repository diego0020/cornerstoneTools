# Plugins

`cornerstoneTools` v3.0 comes with a new plugin architecture, so that one can easily drop new tools and modules into cornerstoneTools. This comes with the advantage of not having to maintain a fork of the entire codebase should you wish to include one other tool. However, if you think a tool you have developed would be valued by the wider cornerstone community, please consider submitting a pull request and contributing it back.
